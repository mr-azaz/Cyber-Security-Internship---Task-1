| **Port** | **Service**               | **Protocol** | **Description**                                                                                      | **Cybersecurity Insight**                                                                                                                          |

| 22       | **SSH** (Secure Shell)    | TCP          | Used for secure remote login to servers/devices. Common in Linux systems.                            | üîê Strong encryption but **targeted for brute-force attacks** if exposed to public networks. Use **key-based authentication**, disable root login. |
| 23       | **Telnet**                | TCP          | Provides remote login like SSH but **unencrypted**.                                                  | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Highly insecure**. Transmits everything in plain text (including passwords). Should be **disabled or replaced with SSH**.                     |
| 53       | **Domain (DNS)**          | TCP/UDP      | Resolves domain names to IP addresses. Typically used by DNS servers.                                | üîé Often exploited in **DNS poisoning** or **amplification DDoS attacks**. Keep patched and monitor for abuse.                                     |
| 80/tcp   | **tcpwrapped**            | TCP          | A result shown by Nmap when it can‚Äôt identify the actual service due to access control or filtering. | üõ° Indicates the service is **protected by TCP wrappers** or a firewall. This is **not a vulnerability**, but it hides what's running underneath.  |
| 443/tcp  | **ssl/tcpwrapped**        | TCP          | Same as above, but over an **SSL-encrypted** connection (e.g., HTTPS).                               | üîê Suggests a **secure service** like HTTPS is protected or hidden. Can also mean Nmap couldn't detect due to SSL handshakes failing.              |
| 1061/tcp | **Kiosk / Web Interface** | TCP          | Often used for web admin panels, kiosks, routers, etc.                                               | ‚ö†Ô∏è If unsecured, can expose internal control panels or settings. Should be protected by authentication and access rules.                           |
